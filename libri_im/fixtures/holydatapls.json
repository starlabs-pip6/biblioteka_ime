And of course she must be able to present herself well in high society. But when he is encouraged to consider Phoebe Marlow as a bride; Sylvester is taken aback by the coltish woman who seems to resent him... The first time Sylvester met Phoebe; he found her dull and insipid. Phoebe; was a hoydenish country miss with literary aspirations. And when she was snubbed by the Duke; and she thought he was insufferably arrogant. In fact; she deemed him the most arrogant rake she'd ever met. In secret; she'd fashioned the villain and a knave in her romance novel unmistakably after Sylvester! Phoebe meets none of Duke's criteria for a fiancee. But when Phoebe ran away; she got his attention and fancy. Intrigued Sylvester decides that if Petruchio could tame Katherine; he had no doubt he could tame Phoebe. And when a series of unforeseen events leads them to be stranded together in a lonely country inn; they are both forced to reassess their hastily formed opinions; and they begin to discover a new-found liking and respect for each other; and they find striking up an unusual friendship. Phoebe discovers that the duke isn't the villian she first thought. And Sylvester stumbles upon something he never dared hope for... But what Sylvester doesn't know is that Phoebe has just published a novel - a novel in which all London will recognize him. But how could she guess her book would be a scandalous success? Or that the man she had cast as a villain would become the heartbreaking hero of her dreams?",

Mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married; and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages. How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be; according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá. While debunking almost everything we \"know\" about sex; they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book. Ryan and Jethá's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food; child care; and; often; sexual partners. Weaving together convergent; frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology; archaeology; primatology; anatomy; and psychosexuality; the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar; intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love; cooperation; and generosity. With intelligence; humor; and wonder; Ryan and Jethá show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy; sexual orientation; and family dynamics. They explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality. In the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing;   unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.",

It was also a land withered by drought and hunger; and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy; and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misala�??crazy�??but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do. Enchanted by the workings of electricity as a boy; William had a goal to study science in Malawi's top boarding schools. But in 2002; his country was stricken with a famine that left his family's farm devastated and his parents destitute. Unable to pay the eighty-dollar-a-year tuition for his education; William was forced to drop out and help his family forage for food as thousands across the country starved and died. Yet William refused to let go of his dreams. With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach; a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks; and an armory of curiosity and determination; he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessity�??electricity and running water. Using scrap metal; tractor parts; and bicycle halves; William forged a crude yet operable windmill; an unlikely contraption and small miracle that eventually powered four lights; complete with homemade switches and a circuit breaker made from nails and wire. A second machine turned a water pump that could battle the drought and famine that loomed with every season. Soon; news of William's  �??his \"electric wind\"�??spread beyond the borders of his home; and the boy who was once called crazy became an inspiration to those around the world. Here is the remarkable story about human inventiveness and its power to overcome crippling adversity.   will inspire anyone who doubts the power of one individual's ability to change his community and better the lives of those around him.",

In 1988 he is forty-seven; living in San Francisco. Suddenly he is - still his modern self - wandering in a city and time he knows mysteriously well:   Vienna. It is 1897; precisely ninety-one years before his last memory and a half-century before his birth.  It's not long before Wheeler has acquired appropriate clothes; money; lodging; a group of young Viennese intellectuals as friends; a mentor in Sigmund Freud; a bitter rival; a powerful crush on a luminous young American woman; a passing acquaintance with local celebrity Mark Twain; and an incredible and surprising insight into the dashing young war-hero father he never knew.  But the truth at the center of Wheeler's dislocation in time remains a stubborn mystery that will take months of exploration and a lifetime of memories to unravel and that will; in the end; reveal nothing short of the eccentric Burden family's unrivaled impact on the very course of the coming century.   is a masterpiece of unequaled storytelling that announces Selden Edwards as one of the most dazzling; original; entertaining; and inventive novelists of our time.",

Covering the years 1944-45; the 170-page journal contain Published here in its entirety; Frida Kahlo's amazing illustrated journal documents the last ten years of her turbulent life. This passionate; often surprising; intimate record; kept under lock and key for some forty years in Mexico; reveals many new dimensions in the complex persona of this remarkable Mexican artist. Covering the years 1944-45; the 170-page journal contains Frida's thoughts; poems; and dreams; and reflects her stormy relationship with her husband; Diego Rivera; Mexico's famous artist. The seventy watercolor illustrations in the journal - some lively sketches; several elegant self-portraits; others complete paintings - offer insights into her creative process; and show her frequently using the journal to work out pictorial ideas for her canvases. The text entries; written in Frida's round; full script in brightly colored inks; add an almost decorative quality; making the journal as captivating to look at as it is to read. Frida's childhood; her political sensibilities; and her obsession with Diego are all illuminated in witty phrases and haunting images. Although much has been written recently about this extraordinary woman; Frida Kahlo's art and life continue to fascinate the world. This personal document; published in a complete full-color facsimile edition; will add greatly to the understanding of her unique and powerful vision and her enormous courage in the face of more than thirty-five operations to correct injuries she had sustained in an accident at the age of eighteen. The facsimile is accompanied by an introduction by the world-renowned Mexican man of letters Carlos Fuentes and a complete translation of the diary's text. An essay on the place of the diary in Frida's work and in art history at large; as well as commentaries on the images; is provided by Sarah M. Lowe.",

While recuperating from wartime Warsaw in the Polish countryside; the unnamed narrator and his friend; Fryderyk; attempt to force amour between two local youths; Karol and Henia; as a kind of a lewd entertainment. They become increasingly frustrated as they discover that the two have no interest in one another; and the games are momentarily stopped by a local murder and a directive to assassinate a rogue member of the Polish resistance. Gombrowicz connects these threads magnificently in a tense climax that imbues his novel with a deep sense of the absurd and multiplies its complexity. Gombrowicz is a relentless psychoanalyzer and a consummate stylist; his prose is precise and forceful; and the narrator's strained attempts to elucidate why he takes such pleasure at soiling youth creepily evoke authentic pride and disgust. Borchardt's translation (the first into English from the original Polish) is a model of consistency; maintaining a manic tone as it navigates between lengthy; comma-spliced sentences and sharp; declarative thrusts. - Publishers Weekly",

His twenty-three international bestsellers have ranged from the beloved Shannara series to stories that tread a much darker path. Armageddon�??s Children is a new creation�??the perfect opportunity for readers unfamiliar with Brooks�??s previous work to experience an author at the height of his considerable storytelling powers. It is a gripping chronicle of a once-familiar world now spun shockingly out of control; in which an extraordinary few struggle to salvage hope in the face of terrifying chaos.  Logan Tom is doomed to remember the past and determined to rescue the future. Far behind him lies a boyhood cut violently short by his family�??s slaughter; when the forces of madness and hate swept our world after decadent excesses led to civilization�??s downfall. Somewhere ahead of him rests the only chance to beat back the minions of evil that are systematically killing and enslaving the last remnants of humanity. Navigating the scarred and poisoned landscape that once was America and guided by a powerful talisman; Logan has sworn an oath to seek out a remarkable being born of magic; possessed of untold abilities; and destined to lead the final fight against darkness. Across the country; Angel Perez; herself a survivor of the malevolent; death-dealing forces combing the land; has also been chosen for an uncanny mission in the name of her ruined world�??s salvation. From the devastated streets of Los Angeles; she will journey to find a place�??and a people�??shrouded in mystery; celebrated in legend; and vital to the cause of humankind . . . even as a relentless foe follows close behind; bent on her extermination. While in the nearly forsaken city of Seattle; a makeshift family of refugees has carved out a tenuous existence among the street gangs; mutants; and marauders fighting to stay alive against mounting odds�??and something unspeakable that has come from the shadows in search of prey.  In time; all their paths will cross. Their common purpose will draw them together. Their courage and convictions will be tested and their fates will be decided; as their singular crusade begins: to take back; or lose forever; the only world they have. In Armageddon�??s Children; Brooks brings his gifts as a mythmaker to the timeless theme of the unending; essential conflict between darkness and light�??and carries his unique imaginative vision to a stunning new level. Prepare for a breathtaking tour de force. To those who are new to Terry Brooks; welcome. And to those who have read him for many years: prepare for a dramatic surprise.",

Born into minor German nobility; she transformed herself into an empress by sheer determination. Possessing a brilliant; curious mind; she devoured the works of Enlightenment philosophers; and reaching the throne; tried using their principles to rule the vast; backward empire. She knew or corresponded with notable figures of her time: Voltaire; Diderot; Frederick the Great; Maria Theresa of Austria; Marie Antoinette \u0026 John Paul Jones. Wanting to be the �??benevolent despot�?� Montesquieu idealized; she contended with the deeply ingrained realities of Russian life; including serfdom. She persevered; and for 34 years the government; foreign policy; cultural development and welfare of the Russian people were in her hands. She dealt with domestic rebellion; wars \u0026 the tides of political change and violence inspired by the French Revolution. Her reputation depended on the perspective of the speaker. She was praised by Voltaire as like the classical philosophers. She was condemned by enemies; mostly foreign; as �??the Messalina of the north.�?� Her family; friends; ministers; generals; lovers and enemies are vividly described. These included her ambitious; scheming mother; her weak; bullying husband; Peter (who left her sexually untouched for nine years after their marriage); her unhappy son \u0026 heir; Paul; her beloved grandchildren; and her favorites�??the young men from whom she sought companionship and the recapture of youth as well as sex. Here; too; is Gregory Potemkin; her most significant lover \u0026 possible husband; with whom she shared a correspondence of love \u0026 separation; followed by 17 years of unparalleled mutual achievement. All the qualities that Massie brought to Nicholas \u0026 Alexandra and Peter the Great are present: historical accuracy; deep understanding; felicity of style; mastery of detail; ability to shatter myth \u0026 a genius for finding and expressing a human drama.",

The time is the 15th century; when intrepid merchants became the new knighthood of Europe. Among them; none is bolder or more cunning than Nicholas vander Poele of Bruges; the good-natured dyer's apprentice who schemes and swashbuckles his way to the helm of a mercantile empire. In 1461; Nicholas is in Florence. Backed by none other than Cosimo de' Medici; he will sail the Black Sea to Trebizond; last outpost of Byzantium; and the last jewel missing from the crown of the Ottoman Empire. But trouble lies ahead. Nicholas's stepdaughter -- at the tender age of thirteen -- has eloped with his rival in trade: a Machiavellian Genoese who races ahead of Nicholas; sowing disaster at every port. And time is of the essence: Trebizond may fall to the Turks at any moment. Crackling with wit; breathtakingly paced;   is a pyrotechnic blend of scholarship and narrative shimmering with the scents; sounds; colors; and combustible emotions of the 15th century.",

The novel is generally a satirical attack on the Ghanaian society during Kwame Nkrumah�??s regime and the period immediately after independence in the 1960s. It is often claimed to rank with \"Things Fall Apart\" as one of the high points of post-colonial African Literature.  A quote from Chapter 6:  \"And where is my solid ground these days? Let us say just that the cycle from birth to decay has been short. Short; brief. But otherwise not at all unusual. And even in the decline into the end there are things that remind the longing mind of old beginnings and hold out the promise of new ones; things even like your despair itself. I have heard this pain before; only then it was multiplied many; many times; but that may only be because at that time I was not so alone; so far apart. Maybe there are other lonely voices despairing now. I will not be entranced by the voice; even if it should swell as it did in the days of hope. I will not be entranced; since I have seen the destruction of the promises it made. But I shall not resist it either. I will be like a cork. It is so surprising; is it not; how even the worst happenings of the past acquire a sweetness in the memory. Old harsh distresses are now merely pictures and tastes which hurt no more; like itching scars which can only give pleasure now. Strange; because when I can think soberly about it all; with out pushing any later joys into the deepr past; I can remember that things were terrible then. When the war was over the soldiers came back to homes broken in their absence and they themselves brought murder in their hearts and gave it to those nearest them. I saw it; not very clearly; because I had no way of understanding it; but it frightened me. We had gone on marches of victory and I do not think there was anyone mean enough in spirit to ask whether we knew what we were celebrating. Whose victory? Ours? It did not matter. We marched; and only a dishonest fool will look back on his boyhood and say he knew even then that there was no meaning in any of it. It is so funny now; to remember that we all thought we were welcoming victory. Or perhaps there is nothing funny here at all; and it is only that victory itself happens to be the identical twin of defeat. \"",

The question is; what does he want with her? Can he help her find a little old toy maker who has skipped out on his bail right before Christmas? Can he survive the Plum family holiday dinner?

When they first meet on a trolley p Tom Cole; the grandson of a legendary local hero; has inherited an uncanny knack for reading the Niagara River's whims and performing daring feats of rescue at the mighty falls. And like the tumultuous meeting of the cataract's waters with the rocks below; a chance encounter between Tom and 17-year-old Bess Heath has an explosive effect. When they first meet on a trolley platform; Bess immediately recognizes the chemistry between them; and the feeling is mutual.  But the hopes of young love are constrained by the 1915 conventions of Niagara Falls; Ontario. Tom's working-class pedigree doesn't suit Bess's family; despite their recent fall from grace. Sacked from his position at a hydroelectric power company; Bess's father has taken to drink; forcing her mother to take in sewing for the society women who were once her peers. Bess pitches in as she pines for Tom; but at her young age; she's unable to fully realize how drastically her world is about to change.  Set against the resounding backdrop of the falls; Cathy Marie Buchanan's carefully researched; capaciously imagined debut novel entwines the romantic trials of a young couple with the historical drama of the exploitation of the river's natural resources. The current of the river; like that of the human heart; is under threat: \"Sometimes it seems like the river is being made into this measly thing;\" says Tom; bemoaning the shortsighted schemes of the power companies. \"The river's been bound up with cables and concrete and steel; like a turkey at Christmastime.\"  Skillfully portraying individuals; families; a community; and an environment imperiled by progress and the devastations of the Great War;   beautifully evokes the wild wonder of its setting; a wonder that always overcomes any attempt to tame it. But at the same time; Buchanan's tale never loses hold of the gripping emotions of Tom and Bess's intimate drama. The result is a transporting novel that captures both the majesty of nature and the mystery of love. Also; download the free study guide:  .",

With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world. Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene; when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia; Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich; tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here; into the unsettled ground of science; faith; and everyday truces between reason and conviction.  Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now; after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm; she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst; she encounters a shocking sight: a silent; forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle; but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists; religious leaders; and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists; opportunists; sightseers; and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle; Dellarobia confronts her family; her church; her town; and a larger world; in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.  Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.",

The   is an entirely original translation of the Holy Scriptures into contemporary English; based on the Masoretic (the traditional Hebrew) text. It is the culmination of three decades of collaboration by academic scholars and rabbis; representing the three largest branches of organized Judaism in the United States. Not since the third century b.c.e.; when 72 elders of the tribes of Israel created the Greek translation of Scriptures known as the Septuagint has such a broad-based committee of Jewish scholars produced a major Bible translation. In executing this monumental task; the translators made use of the entire range of biblical interpretation; ancient and modern; Jewish and non-Jewish. They drew upon the latest findings in linguistics and archaeology; as well as the work of early rabbinic and medieval commentators; grammarians; and philologians. The resulting text is a triumph of literary style and biblical scholarship; unsurpassed in accuracy and clarity. Ebook versions of this title may be purchased from most ebook vendors.",

Hailed by Time as \"brilliant literary comedy as well as a brilliant sketch of the times;\" A Dance to the Music of Time opens just after World War I. Amid the fever of the 1920s and the first chill of the 1930s; Nick Jenkins and his friends confront sex; society; business; and art. In the second volume they move to London in a whirl of marriage and adulteries; fashions and frivolities; personal triumphs and failures. These books \"provide an unsurpassed picture; at once gay and melancholy; of social and artistic life in Britain between the wars\" (Arthur Schlesinger; Jr.). The third volume follows Nick into army life and evokes London during the blitz. In the climactic final volume; England has won the war and must now count the losses. In this third volume of  ; we again meet Widmerpool; doggedly rising in rank; Jenkins; shifted from one dismal army post to another; Stringham; heroically emerging from alcoholism; Templer; still on his eternal sexual quest. Here; too; we are introduced to Pamela Flitton; one of the most beautiful and dangerous women in modern fiction. Wickedly barbed in its wit; uncanny in its seismographic recording of human emotions and social currents; this saga stands as an unsurpassed rendering of England's finest yet most costly hour. Includes these novels: \"Anthony Powell is the best living English novelist by far. His admirers are addicts; let us face it; held in thrall by a magician.\"�?? \"A book which creates a world and explores it in depth; which ponders changing relationships and values; which creates brilliantly living and diverse characters and then watches them grow and change in their milieu. . . . Powell's world is as large and as complex as Proust's.\"�??Elizabeth Janeway;  \"One of the most important works of fiction since the Second World War. . . . The novel looked; as it began; something like a comedy of manners; then; for a while; like a tragedy of manners; now like a vastly entertaining; deeply melancholy; yet somehow courageous statement about human experience.\"�??Naomi Bliven;",

The introduction is by comedienne extraordinaire Whoopi Goldberg; who reveals which   character she has tattooed on her body (and where)�??as well as telling of her meeting with \"Sparky\" Schulz; and her fascinating theory on Snoopy's brother Spike.

During that spell-fueled war; Sacoridia was besieged by the sorcerou Karigan G'ladheon is a Green Rider--a seasoned member of the elite messenger corps of King Zachary of Sacoridia. This corps of messengers; each gifted with a brooch of office that imparts a unique magical ability to its wearer; was founded over a thousand years ago during the terrible time of the Long War. During that spell-fueled war; Sacoridia was besieged by the sorcerous armies of the Arcosian Empire; led by Mornhavon the Black. When Sacoridia finally triumphed; Mornhavon resorted to dark magic that rendered his twisted spirit immortal. Determined to keep the realm safe from this terrifying enemy; multitudes of Sacoridian magicians sacrificed their lives to build the immense D'Yer Wall; imprisoning the dangerous spirit of Mornhavon in Blackveil Forest; which uncontrolled magic had mutated into a perilous and unnatural place. For over a thousand years; the magic of the D'Yer Wall protected the people of Sacoridia; but as the centuries passed; memory of how the wall had been built was lost as a traumatized nation turned its back on magic. And when a malicious entity cracked the massive wall; there were none left who knew how to repair it. Desperate to regain the knowledge and repair the ever-expanding breach in the wall; agents of the king scoured the kingdom for magical relics and information. Finally; in a last-ditch attempt to gain time; Karigan; whose Rider brooch enabled her to \"fade\"--sometimes traversing the layers of time and space--was able to catapult the spirit of Mornhavon into the future. But how far into the future was anyone's guess. Realizing that this might be their only chance to enter Blackveil and examine the tainted peninsula; King Zachary sends Karigan and a contingent of Sacoridians beyond the wall; along with an equal number of Eletians--the immortal race that eons ago lived in what is now Blackveil Forest. But in addition to the unnatural dangers of the forest itself; Karigan and her small delegation have been followed by a secret rebel sect--descendants of the original Arcosian invaders; and during a showdown between these two groups; Mornhavon suddenly reappears. In the magical confrontation that follows; Karigan is jolted out of Blackveil and wakes in a darkness blacker than night. She's lying on smooth; cold stone; but as she reaches out; she realizes that the stone is not just beneath her; but above and around her as well. She's landed in a sealed stone sarcophagus; some unknown tomb; and the air is becoming thin. Is this to be her end? If she escapes; where will she find herself? Is she still in the world she remembers; or has the magical explosion transported her somewhere completely different? To find out; she must first win free of her prison--before it becomes her grave. And should she succeed; will she be walking straight into a trap created by Mornhavon himself?",

Her condition has doctors mystified; but Ren e can never reveal the truth: she died last May; and was brought back to life by the kiss of her Undead soul mate; Dante Berlin.  Now; her separation from Dante becomes almost unbearable. His second life is close to an end; and each passing day means one less that she will spend with the boy who shares her soul. Just when Ren e has almost given up hope; she learns of the Nine Sisters-brilliant scholars who; according to legend; found a way to cheat death. She can't shake the feeling that they are somehow connected to her dreams; strange visions that hint at a discovery so powerful; and so dangerous; that some will stop at nothing to protect it.  Ren e thought she knew the truth about life and death. But there is a secret woven through history that holds the only hope for Dante and Ren e. Unless they find answers soon; their time together is doomed to be cut short.",

It�??s clearly a surveillance film of Lucy taken almost twenty years ago. As Scarpetta watches she comes to grips with frightening secrets about her niece; whom she loves like a daughter. That first clip and others sent soon after raise dangerous implications that increasingly isolate Scarpetta and leave her confused; alarmed; and not knowing where to turn. She doesn�??t know whom she can tell �?? not her FBI agent husband; Benton Wesley; or her investigative partner; Pete Marino. Not even Lucy. Cornwell launches these unforgettable characters on an intensely psychological odyssey that includes the bizarre death of a Hollywood mogul�??s daughter; wreckage on the bottom of the sea in the Bermuda Triangle; a grisly gift left in the back of a crime scene truck; and videos from the past that threaten to destroy Scarpetta�??s entire world and everyone she loves. The diabolical presence and singularly \"depraved heart\" behind what unfolds seems obvious - but strangely; not to the FBI. Certainly that�??s the message they send when they start harassing Lucy and begin building a case that could send her to prison for the rest of her life.

Beginning with Reichl's mother; the notorious food-poisoner known as the Queen of Mold; Reichl introduces us to the fascinating characters who shaped her world and her tastes; from the gourmand Monsieur du Croix; who served Reichl her first soufflé ; to those at her politically correct table in Berkeley who championed the organic food revolution in the 1970s. Spiced with Reichl's infectious humor and sprinkled with her favorite recipes; Tender at the Bone is a witty and compelling chronicle of a culinary sensualist's coming-of-age.",

Wells described The Old Wives' Tale as \"by far the finest long novel written in English and in the English fashion\". He was; of course; speaking for his own generation; and a hundred years later the opinion may seem somewhat exaggerated. However; there is no doubt that   is a superb novel of its kind; and it is still as readable and enjoyable as ever. First published in 1908; it tells the story of the Baines sisters--shy; retiring Constance and defiant; romantic Sophia--over the course of nearly half a century. Bennett traces the lives of the sisters from childhood in their father's drapery shop in provincial Bursley; England; during the mid-Victorian era; through their married lives; to the modern industrial age; when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris. It was fascinating to learn from Bennett's journal how he saw an old lady in a cafe and was inspired to think of how her life might have been lived; how she must have once been young. The plot of the novel came to him fairly promptly; and; as they say; the rest is history. This novel was serialized on British television with great success circa 2000.",

Yet it's Bex who seeks adventure at Oxford and finds herself living down the hall from Prince Nicholas; Great Britain's future king.

Tintin's flat is even bombed in an attempt to kill him. Suspecting a Syldavian connection; Tintin offers to accompany Alembick to Syldavia for research. On the plane Tintin begins to suspect his companion. The Alembick travelling with him doesn't smoke and doesn't seem to need the spectacles he wears; while the Alembick he first met smoked heavily and had very poor eyesight. During a layover; Tintin fakes a fall and grabs Alembick's beard; thinking it is false and Alembick is an imposter. However; it is (for Alembick) painfully real. Tintin decides to let the matter drop but then; while flying over Syldavia; it is the pilot of the plane who opens a trap door and Tintin drops out; landing in a haywagon. Tintin has a hunch that a plot is afoot to steal the sceptre of King Ottokar IV. In Syldavia; the reigning King must possess the sceptre to rule or he will be forced to abdicate. Every year he rides in a parade during St. Vladimir's Day carrying it; while the people sing the national anthem. Tintin succeeds in warning the reigning King; Muskar XII; despite the efforts of the conspirators. He and the King rush to the royal treasure room to find Alembick; the royal photographer and some guards unconscious and the sceptre missing. Tintin's friends Thomson and Thompson are summoned to investigate but their theory on how the sceptre was stolen proves bad and painful for them. Later on; Tintin notices a spring cannon in a toy shop and this gives him the clue. Professor Alembick had asked for some photographs to be taken of the sceptre; but the camera was a spring cannon in disguise; which allowed him to catapult it out of the castle into a nearby forest. Searching the forest; Tintin spots the sceptre being found by agents of the neighbouring country; Borduria. Following them all the way to the border; he wrests the sceptre from them. In the wallet of one of the thieves he discovers papers that show that the theft of the sceptre was just part of a major plan for the taking over of Syldavia by their long-time political rival; Borduria. Tintin steals a Me-109 from a Bordurian airfield (whose squadron is being kept ready to take part in the envisioned \"Anschluss\" of Syldavia) to fly it back to the King in time. He is shot down by the Syldavians who have naturally opened fire on an enemy aircraft violating their airspace. He manages to make the rest of the journey by foot. Meanwhile the Interior Minister informs the King that rumours have been spreading that the sceptre has been stolen and that there have been riots against local Bordurian businesses; acts which would justify a Bordurian takeover of the country. The King is about to abdicate when Snowy runs in with the sceptre (which had fallen out of Tintin's pocket). Tintin then gives the King the papers he took from the man who stole the sceptre. They prove that the plot was masterminded by Müsstler; leader of the Iron Guard; a local political party. The King takes action by having Müsstler and his associates arrested and the army mobilised along the Bordurian frontier. In response; the Bordurian leader pulls his own troops back from the border; though he stresses his own country's \"desire for peace\" and criticises Syldavia's \"strange\" behaviour. The next day is St. Vladimir's Day and Tintin is made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican; the first non-Syldavian to receive such an honour. Further inquiries by the authorities reveal that; in a classic Ruritanian plot device; Professor Alembick is one of a pair of identical twins: Hector Alembick was kidnapped and replaced with his brother Alfred who left for Syldavia in his place. Tintin and Snowy return home by a flying boat with Thomson and Thompson; who suffer momentary panic when the aircraft appears to be falling into the sea at the end of the flight. The reader is treated to a rare \"wink to the camera\" from Tintin; who points out their error; and they laugh about it so much that they do indeed fall into the sea as they disembark.",

In 1975; coach Harlan Brown is hiding from his past at an obscure New York college; after he was fired from Penn State University on suspicion of being gay. A tough; lonely ex-Marine of 39; Harlan has never allowed himself to love another man.  Then Billy Sive; a brilliant young runner; shows up on his doorstep. He and his two comrades; Vince Matti and Jacques LaFont; were just thrown off a major team for admitting they are gay. Harlan knows that; with proper training; Billy could go to the '76 Olympics in Montreal. He agrees to coach the three boys under strict conditions that thwart Billy's growing attraction for his mature but compelling mentor. The lean; graceful frontrunner with gold-rim glasses sees directly into Harlan's heart. Billy's gentle and open acceptance of his sexuality makes Harlan afraid to confront either the pain of his past; or the challenges which lay in wait if their intimacy is exposed.  But when Coach Brown finds himself falling in love with his most gifted athlete; he must combat his true feelings for Billy or risk the outrage of the entire sports world - and their only chance at Olympic gold.",

Veteran   reporter Michael Dobbs has pored over previously untapped American; Soviet; and Cuban sources to produce the most authoritative book yet on the Cuban missile crisis In October 1962; at the height of the Cold War; the United States and the Soviet Union appeared to be sliding inexorably toward a nuclear conflict over the placement of missiles in Cuba. Veteran   reporter Michael Dobbs has pored over previously untapped American; Soviet; and Cuban sources to produce the most authoritative book yet on the Cuban missile crisis. In his hour-by-hour chronicle of those near-fatal days; Dobbs reveals some startling new incidents that illustrate how close we really did come to Armageddon.  Here; for the first time; are gripping accounts of Khrushchev's plan to destroy the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo; the accidental overflight of the Soviet Union by an American spy plane; the movement of Soviet nuclear warheads around Cuba during the tensest days of the crisis; the activities of CIA agents inside Cuba; and the crash landing of an American F-106 jet with a live nuclear weapon on board.  Dobbs takes us inside the White House and the Kremlin as Kennedy and Khrushchev--rational; intelligent men separated by an ocean of ideological suspicion--agonize over the possibility of war. He shows how these two leaders recognized the terrifying realities of the nuclear age while Castro--never swayed by conventional political considerations--demonstrated the messianic ambition of a man selected by history for a unique mission. As the story unfolds; Dobbs brings us onto the decks of American ships patrolling Cuba; inside sweltering Soviet submarines and missile units as they ready their warheads; and onto the streets of Miami; where anti-Castro exiles plot the dictator's overthrow.  Based on exhaustive new research and told in breathtaking prose; here is ariveting account of history's most dangerous hours; full of lessons for our time.",

In the years between the two world wars; the future held more promise than peril; but there was evidence of things unseen that would transfigure our unquestioned trust in a safe future.  Fos has returned to Tennessee from the trenches of France. Intrigued with electricity; bioluminescence; and especially x-rays; he believes in science and the future of technology. On a trip to the Outer Banks to study the Perseid meteor shower; he falls in love with Opal; whose father is a glassblower who can spin color out of light. Fos brings his new wife back to Knoxville where he runs a photography studio with his former Army buddy Flash. A witty rogue and a staunch disbeliever in Prohibition; Flash brings tragedy to the couple when his appetite for pleasure runs up against both the law and the Ku Klux Klan. Fos and Opal are forced to move to Opal's mother's farm on the Clinch River; and soon they have a son; Lightfoot. But when the New Deal claims their farm for the TVA; Fos seeks work at the Oak Ridge Laboratory -- Site X in the government's race to build the bomb.  And it is there; when Opal falls ill with radiation poisoning; that Fos's great faith in science deserts him. Their lives have traveled with touching inevitability from their innocence and fascination with \"things that glow\" to the new world of manmade suns.  Hypnotic and powerful;   constructs a heartbreaking arc through twentieth-century American life and belief.",

Each man's grief demands a confrontation with the other's if it is to be resolved: a resolution more compelling to both than the demands of war.

This fast paced; biographical work contains layers of storyline with twists and turns that are poignant; and startling. Join three young men�??s true stories as they launch themselves onto the college football scene and refuse to be denied their impact both on and off the field. These mistakenly overlooked college football players take over a struggling football team with their drive and motivation; all in an effort to rise to the challenge of one more football season. Living on the edge of college life as driven athletes; they face a dramatic conspiracy as they struggle in the face of athletic romance; real world politics of organizational behavior and creating their own futures as they are forced to lead the world around them much sooner than they ever expected. Heavy is the head that wears the crown as these extraordinary athletes have decisions to make that are crowded by circumstances that continually provide opportunities for them to fail in rising to the level of achievement that they know they have earned. Understanding their romantic interests and hearing their sex stories as they struggle not to be dragged under provides a highly insightful gaze into their world. The dynamics of college football; deciding on a future and motivation for achievement are illustrated here in a true story of the thin line between being an exceptional football player and the ever expanding world of claims that all performers are equal despite the results that prove to differentiate those same performers. At a new school; on a new team; joining the college ranks; these young men face more reality than they anticipated as they hold their future in their own hands and are first hand participants in the real world evolution of organizational politicking; power struggles and the freedom to pursue the college endeavor as they see fit.  This true story is worth picking up simply to have an accurate overview of the inner workings and value of university education; college football and organizational manipulation. It serves as both a remarkable story of college life and as an instruction manual to the pitfalls of the people surrounding exceptional individuals; in addition to the political motivations of higher education organizations. College football; coaching motivations and the nature of organizational leaders is clearly depicted here as your guide.

One of the most extraordinary survival stories ever told -- Aron Ralston's searing account of his six days trapped in one of the most remote spots in America; and how one inspired act of bravery brought him home.  It started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston; a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman; a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation; and though he met two charming women along the way; by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone; with just the beauty of the natural world all around him.  It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck; in a deep and narrow slot canyon; Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly; and terrifyingly; came loose. Before he could get out of the way; the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall.  And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food; no jacket for the painfully cold nights; and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed; he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days; Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin; he'd most probably have died of dehydration; if a flash flood didn't drown him before that.  What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack; Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country; thinking back over a life filled with adventure; and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part; his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron; the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive; until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself.  Between a Rock and a Hard Place -- a brilliantly written; funny; honest; inspiring; and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.",

The quaint mountain town of Ruidoso; New Mexico; is the perfect place for Isaac Snow to raise his family. But when eight-year-old daughters; Caroline and Josie; commit an innocent act of heroism; media coverage attracts the wrong kind of attention. Soon; their life unravels; leading them to the crossroads of love and hate; forgiveness and retribution.  In the dark hours of a drizzly morning; Isaac; an ex-air force pilot; wakes to find a masked intruder cradling one of the twins in his arms. Before he can react; the man in black leaps through the nearest window; plummeting in a tangle of body parts and glass. Isaac charges in pursuit; but is suddenly faced with a new dilemma. Caroline is unconscious; lying facedown in the lawn; cuts from the shattered window saturating her pajamas. If he gives chase; his little girl will surely bleed to death.  From a secretive loner with a pension for unrestrained violence to the pristine granite peaks of the Rocky Mountains--from laughter filled family dinners to a string of cross-country abductions; LANDON PARHAM'S debut novel relentlessly explores the horrific realities of unnatural lust and obsession. Taken well beyond the investigation and law-enforcement tactics; you'll find yourself steeped in journey of evil and torment; and the power of family that overcomes it all.

They were more. They were fluid.

Hoe kon de vroegere; relatief rustige kolonie van België; sinds 1960 onafhankelijk; zo veranderen? David Van Reybrouck beschrijft voor het eerst de verbijsterende geschiedenis van Congo; van ruim voor de komst van de ontdekkingsreiziger Stanley tot en met de invloed van China in de laatste tien jaar en de recente economische crisis. Van 1885 tot 1908 werd het land bestierd door koning Leopold ii; die een fortuin verdiende met de exploitatie van rubber. De kolonisatie door België in de periode van 1908 tot 1960 zorgde voor industrialisatie en infrastructuur; maar werd ook gekenmerkt door paternalisme; zo niet betutteling. De onverhoedse overgang van kolonie naar onafhankelijke staat rond 1960 is een adembenemend verhaal vol idealisme en gekonkel. Het nieuwe land stortte zich in een turbulent avontuur dat steeds wilder en chaotischer werd en na tweeëndertig jaar dictatuur onder Mobutu leidde tot een van de dodelijkste conflicten sinds de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Van Reybrouck baseert zich niet alleen op zeldzaam archiefmateriaal en baanbrekend onderzoek; maar vooral ook op honderden gesprekken die hij met Congolezen voerde. Zijn ooggetuigen gaan van eeuwlingen tot kindsoldaten; van rebellenleiders tot smokkelaars; van ministers tot maniokverkoopsters. Hun verhalen heeft de auteur in zijn grote geschiedenis geïntegreerd.",

Jordan Peterson offers a provocative new hypothesis that explores the connection between what modern neuropsychology tells us about the brain and what rituals; myths; and religious stories have long narrated. A cutting-edge work that brings together neuropsychology; cognitive science; and Freudian and Jungian approaches to mythology and narrative;     presents a rich theory that makes the wisdom and meaning of myth accessible to the critical modern mind.",

Wall Street speculators; the Manhattan downtown club scene; Russian gangsters; immigrant neighborhoods - all the elements in the urban turf of this finely crafted contemporary crime novel wed danger with excitement and possibility. They're the rewards that Monty Brogan; who stands at the center of the moral glare in this tale; has already lost; just as he's lost his Corvette; and the \"sway\" that opened the doors of exclusive night spots and guaranteed him courtside seats at Madison Square Garden. Tomorrow Monty's traveling by bus; to the federal prison in Otisville; for seven years. He's afraid; and all he'd ever really wanted when he grew up was to be a fireman. With the pulse of the city in its prose; this debut novel follows Monty through the twenty-four hours of his last day out. At the same time; it illuminates the worlds; and souls; of his two best friends: Frank Slattery; an edgy bond trader who gambles daily with financial ruin; and Jakob Elinsky; an English teacher who clings to illusions as he compromises his ideals. Friends since their high school days; the three of them nostalgically share a past; but warily they confront a future that can no longer accommodate their adolescent dreams. They meet. They drink; and talk; go clubbing; dance; drink; and remember. What neither Slattery nor Jakob know; however; is that Monty has a plan. It's a shocker.

He terrorizes little Susie; offers \"Candid Opinions\" from a neighborhood stand; and questions his parents\" authority. \"What assurance do I have that your parenting isn't screwing me up?\" he demands.   manages to say what needs to be said about childhood and life: \"Eww; mud;\" says Calvin. \"Look at this gooshy; dirty; slimy; thick; wet mud... Bleecch... Talk about a kid magnet!\"",

Every aircraft is equipped with an almost indestructible black box. When there is an accident; the box is opened; the data is analyzed; and the reason for the accident excavated. This ensures that procedures are adapted so that the same mistake doesn�??t happen again. With this method; the industry has created an astonishing safety record. For pilots working in a safety-critical industry; getting it wrong can have deadly consequences. But most of us have a relationship with failure that impedes progress; halts innovation; and damages our lives. We don�??t acknowledge it or learn from it �??though we often think we do. Moving from anthropology to psychology and from history to complexity theory; Matthew Syed explains why even when we think we have 20/20 hindsight; our vision�??s still fuzzy. He offers a radical new idea: that the most important determinant of success in any field; whether sports; business; or life; is an acknowledgment of failure and a willingness to engage with it. This is how we learn; progress and excel. This approach explains everything from biological evolution and the efficiency of markets to the success of the Mercedes F1 team and the mindset of David Beckham. Using a cornucopia of interviews; gripping stories; and sharp-edged science; Syed explores the intimate relationship between failure and success; and shows why we need to transport black box thinking into our own lives. If we wish to unleash our potential; we must diagnose and break free of our failures. Part manifesto for change; part intellectual adventure; this groundbreaking book reveals how to do both.",

But God had another plan. One day; while shooting drugs and watching television she heard someone on the 700 Club saying that God loved her; and slowly she began to undertake the arduous journey to reclaim her life.

Emerging from his angst-filled childhood; he rushes into the throes of the twentieth century on the Western Front during the Great War; and quickly changes his role on the battlefield from cannon fodder to cameraman. When he becomes a prisoner of war; he discovers Rousseau's  ; and dedicates his life to bringing the memoir to the silver screen. Plagued by bad luck and blind ambition; Todd becomes a celebrated London upstart; a Weimar luminary; and finally a disgruntled director of cowboy movies and the eleventh member of the Hollywood Ten.

Here is a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on two cinematic masters from very different backgrounds as they cover each of Hitch's films in succession. Though this book was initially published in 1967 when Hitchcock was still active; Truffaut later prepared a revised edition that covered the final stages of his career. It's difficult to think of a more informative or entertaining introduction to Hitchcock's art; interests; and peculiar sense of humor. The book is a storehouse of insight and witticism; including the master's impressions of a classic like   (\"I was feeling very creative at the time; the batteries were well charged\"); his technical insight into  's shower scene (\"the knife never touched the body; it was all done in the [editing]\"); and his ruminations on flops such as   (\"If I were to make another picture in Australia today; I'd have a policeman hop into the pocket of a kangaroo and yell 'Follow that car!'\").

As the date of the predicted earthquake quickly approaches; Kate is forced to reconcile her fraught relationship with her sister and to face truths about herself she�??s long tried to deny.   Funny; haunting; and thought-provoking;   is a beautifully written novel of the obligation we have toward others; and the responsibility we take for ourselves.

Miles soon finds himself trapped at his job; the Royal Cinema Theater; along with his best friend and a group of teenagers who can't seem to get along; even in a time of crisis. With the blood rain cutting off access to many necessary resources; Miles and the others must use their limited supplies to fight an enemy that is much stronger than they are. The race for survival against this new; deadly species is on.",

All of them face an uncertain future in Northern Ireland�??a country of shadows; where nothing is as it seems and the slightest misstep can have deadly consequences.

The long-awaited and beguiling second novel from Alain de Botton that tracks the beautifully complicated arc of a romantic partnership; from the internationally bestselling author of How Proust Can Change Your Life. De Botton's essay \"Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person\" (The New York Times; May 28; 2016); which draws from The Course of Love; was the #1 most emailed article for days. We all know the headiness and excitement of the early days of love. But what comes after? In Edinburgh; a couple; Rabih and Kirsten; fall in love. They get married; they have children�??but no long-term relationship is as simple as \"happily ever after.\" The Course of Love is a novel that explores what happens after the birth of love; what it takes to maintain love; and what happens to our original ideals under the pressures of an average existence. You experience; along with Rabih and Kirsten; the first flush of infatuation; the effortlessness of falling into romantic love; and the course of life thereafter. Interwoven with their story and its challenges is an overlay of philosophy�??an annotation and a guide to what we are reading. This is a Romantic novel in the true sense; one interested in exploring how love can survive and thrive in the long term. The result is a sensory experience�??fictional; philosophical; psychological�??that urges us to identify deeply with these characters and to reflect on his and her own experiences in love. Fresh; visceral; and utterly compelling; The Course of Love is a provocative and life-affirming novel for everyone who believes in love.",

The keys to this empire belong to the powerful North family - composed of successive generations of clones. Yet these clones are not identical. For one thing; genetic errors have crept in with each generation. For another; the original three clone \"brothers\" have gone their separate ways; and the branches of the family are now friendly rivals more than allies.  Or maybe not so friendly. At least that's what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst. Sid is a solid investigator who'd like nothing better than to hand off this hot potato of a case. The way he figures it; whether he solves the crime or not; he'll make enough enemies to ruin his career. Yet Sid's case is about to take an unexpected turn: Because the circumstances of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to a killing that took place years ago on the planet St. Libra; where a North clone and his entire household were slaughtered in cold blood. The convicted slayer; Angela Tramelo; has always claimed her innocence. And now it seems she may have been right. Because only the St. Libra killer could have committed the Newcastle crime. Problem is; Angela also claims that the murderer was an alien monster.  Now Sid must navigate through a Byzantine minefield of competing interests within the police department and the world's political and economic elite...all the while hunting down a brutal killer poised to strike again. And on St. Libra; Angela; newly released from prison; joins a mission to hunt down the elusive alien; only to learn that the line between hunter and hunted is a thin one.",

These texts supply evidence crucial to an understanding of the bizarre mix of Quranic scholarship; CIA training; punctual interventions in Gulf politics and messianic anti-imperialism that has formed the programmatic core of Al Qaeda. In bringing together the various statements issued under bin Laden�??s name since 1994; this volume forms part of a growing discourse that seeks to demythologize the terrorist network. Newly translated from the Arabic; annotated with a critical introduction by Islamic scholar Bruce Lawrence; this collection places the statements in their religious; historical and political context. It shows how bin Laden�??s views draw on and differ from other strands of radical Islamic thought; it also demonstrates how his arguments vary in degrees of consistency; and how his evasions concerning the true nature and extent of his own group; and over his own role in terrorist attacks; have contributed to the perpetuation of his personal mythology.",

Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm; where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town; she is surrounded by women -- her mother; an agnostic; opinionated woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder; the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend; Naomi; with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence. Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex; birth; and death; Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise; witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful; moving; and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.",

Called in to investigate; melancholy Detective Ciccio; a secret admirer of the murdered woman and a friend of her husband�??s; discovers that almost everyone in the apartment building is somehow involved in the case; and with each new development the mystery only deepens and broadens. Gadda�??s sublimely different detective story presents a scathing picture of fascist Italy while tracking the elusiveness of the truth; the impossibility of proof; and the infinite complexity of the workings of fate; showing how they come into conflict with the demands of justice and love.  Italo Calvino; Pier Paolo Pasolini; and Alberto Moravia all considered   to be the great modern Italian novel. Unquestionably; it is a work of universal significance and protean genius: a rich social novel; a comic opera; an act of political resistance; a blazing feat of baroque wordplay; and a haunting story of life and death in the Eternal City.",

The story o  has been ranked #1 Best Florida Book eight times in annual polls conducted by Florida Monthly Magazine. In this best-selling novel; Patrick Smith tells the story of three generations of the MacIveys; a Florida family who battle the hardships of the frontier to rise from a dirt-poor Cracker life to the wealth and standing of real estate tycoons. The story opens in 1858; when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son; and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey; who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need. The sweeping story that emerges is a rich; rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty; indomitable Crackers battling wild animals; rustlers; Confederate deserters; mosquitoes; starvation; hurricanes; and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed; including finally their own. Love and tenderness are here too: the hopes and passions of each new generation; friendships with the persecuted blacks and Indians; and respect for the land and its wildlife.  was winner of the Florida Historical Society's Tebeau Prize as the Most Outstanding Florida Historical Novel.

Maybe he's got The Bomb. And missiles that can reach Riyadh; Tel Aviv; Spokane. Stock up on nonperishable foodstuffs. Grab those Diet Coke cans you were supposed to take to the recycling center and fill them up with home heating oil. Bury the Hummel figurines in the yard. We're all going to die.

Now an even greater danger has surfaced: a threat to the existence of the universe itself. At the very heart of the galaxy is the Void; a self-contained microuniverse that cannot be breached; cannot be destroyed; and cannot be stopped as it steadily expands in all directions; consuming everything in its path: planets; stars; civilizations. The Void has existed for untold millions of years. Even the oldest and most technologically advanced of the galaxy�??s sentient races; the Raiel; do not know its origin; its makers; or its purpose. But then Inigo; an astrophysicist studying the Void; begins dreaming of human beings who live within it. Inigo�??s dreams reveal a world in which thoughts become actions and dreams become reality. Inside the Void; Inigo sees paradise. Thanks to the gaiafield; a neural entanglement wired into most humans; Inigo�??s dreams are shared by hundreds of millions�??and a religion; the Living Dream; is born; with Inigo as its prophet. But then he vanishes. Suddenly there is a new wave of dreams. Dreams broadcast by an unknown Second Dreamer serve as the inspiration for a massive Pilgrimage into the Void. But there is a chance that by attempting to enter the Void; the pilgrims will trigger a catastrophic expansion; an accelerated devourment phase that will swallow up thousands of worlds.  And thus begins a desperate race to find Inigo and the mysterious Second Dreamer. Some seek to prevent the Pilgrimage; others to speed its progress�??while within the Void; a supreme entity has turned its gaze; for the first time; outward. . . .",

Of course; the sisters aren't killing just anyone; only the people who truly deserve it. But the girls have learned from the mistakes of their father; and know that a shred of evidence could get them caught. So when Fancy stumbles upon a mysterious and invisible doorway to another world; she opens a door to endless possibilities.",

In  hailed as �??the most delightful read of the year�?� by Liz Smith in the  authors Jennifer Kaufman and Karen Mack captivated readers with a brilliantly imagined first novel. Now Kaufman and Mack return; introducing a character with a unique voice you�??ll never forget: Cassie Shaw; an irrepressible young woman who reinvents herself�??with unexpected consequences�??in a funny; wise; and utterly original novel about friendship; love; wildlife; and other forces of nature. In the wilds of Topanga Canyon; Cassie is right at home�??with the call of birds; the sound of wind in the trees; the harmony of a world without people. But everywhere else; life is a little harder for Cassie. Her mother believes in Big Foot. Her wisecracking pet parrot is a drama queen. And at the age of thirty; newly single and without a college degree; Cassie desperately needs a decent paycheck. Which is why; against all her principles; she lies on her résumé for an office job at an elite university�??and then finds herself employed in academia by two professors who are as rare as the birds she covets. One of her new bosses is Professor William Conner; a sexy; handsome; cheerfully aristocratic expert in animal behavior. Soon; under Conner�??s charismatic tutelage; Cassie carefully begins her personal transformation while meeting the kind of people who don�??t flock to wildlife preserves�??from impossibly brilliant academics to adorably spoiled college boys. But her future�??and unlikely new career�??is teetering on one unbearable untruth. And Cassie�??s masquerade is about to come undone�?�in a chain of events that will transform her life�??and the lives of those around her�??forever. A novel for late bloomers of every exotic shade and stripe    is pure entertainment�??at once hilarious and wry; lyrical and uplifting.",

Guilty or innocent; Steve becomes a pawn in the hands of \"the system;\" cluttered with cynical authority figures and unscrupulous inmates; who will turn in anyone to shorten their own sentences.

He writes it all down; scene by scene; the story of how his whole life was turned around in an instant.

At its heart are the heroic deeds of Sigurd the dragon slayer who acquires magical knowledge from one of Odin's Valkyries. Yet it is also set in a very human world; incorporating strands from the oral narratives of the fourth and fifth centuries; when Attila the Hun and other warriors fought on the northern frontiers of the Roman Empire. One of the great books of world literature; the saga is an unforgettable tale of princely jealousy; unrequited love; greed and vengeance. With its cursed treasure of the Rhine; sword reforged and magic ring of power; it was a major influence for writers including William Morris and J. R. R. Tolkien and for Wagner's Ring cycle.",

First novelist Forward explores the complications that arise from a surfeit of \"goodness\" in the world. The result is a skewed version of the epic fantasy that features an assassin; a thief; an evil sorceress; a dark knight; and an implacable druid as the villains-turned-heroes who must restore the delicate balance of opposing forces before their world disappears in a blinding flash of Goodness and Light. -- Library Journal Forward's first novel gives the concept of the balance between good and evil a most ingenious twist: What if good were so totally triumphant that it became a worse danger than evil; and a band of unemployed evil characters had to go on a desperate quest to find the means of putting the saving bit of evil back into the world? The result of this twist is an almost straightforward quest tale; with numerous well-drawn characters (including a centaur who starts off as a secret agent for good and eventually joins the side of evil); great ingenuity about magic; very creditable world-building; and considerable wit. Although bearing its share of first-novel flaws; it has many more virtues; which include an underlying; serious examination of the good-evil dichotomy that is the basis of so many role-playing games. -- Roland Green",

Her guardian tells her it is almost impossible that her mother is still alive; but that means still possible. You should never ignore a possible.

When Haregwoin Teferra�??s husband and daughter died within a few years of each other; her life is shattered and she becomes a recluse. But then a priest delivers an orphan to her door. The another; and another... and together they thrive. The distinguished author of Praying for Sheetrock and two-time National Book award finalist puts a human face on the AIDS crisis in Africa.  When Haregwoin Teferra�??s husband and 23-year-old daughter died within a few years of each other; her middle-class life in Addis Ababa; Ethiopia; was shattered. Bereft and with little to live for; Haregwoin became a recluse. Her self-imposed exile to a hut near her daughter�??s grave was interrupted when a priest delivered first one; then another; orphaned teenager into her care. To everyone�??s surprise; the children thrived; and so did Haregwoin. As word spread; children of all ages began to appear at her modest home: an infant brought by a dying mother; an orphaned brother and sister whose grandfather was too poor to feed them; a baby left on her doorstep. Haregwoin�??s small compound became known as the rare place where ailing parents and impoverished families could safely leave their children. Soon Haregwoin was caring for sixty children; running an unofficial orphanage and day school; and learning first-hand about her country�??s and her continent�??s greatest challenge: the AIDS pandemic that is leaving millions of children without parents to care for them.  With the flair and grace of a novelist and the reportorial instincts of a seasoned journalist; Melissa Fay Greene gets to the heart of the AIDS crisis; in a story that is nevertheless one of hope. There Is No Me Without You is the story of Haregwoin and her children: a story of struggle and despair; but also of the triumph of saved lives; and the renewed happiness of children welcomed by adoptive parents in Ethiopia; America; and around the world. Haregewoin�??s remarkable story convinces us that the crisis in Africa touches every one of us in some fundamental way. At heart; this book is about children and the parents they need to care for them.",

Discover The Spiritual Successor To \"The Origin Of Species.\" Religion and science have been fighting an undeclared war for centuries. Ever since we stepped out of the dark ages and modern science started taking its first baby steps; people have been debating the connection between metaphysics and physics. And human evolution is one of the most controversial issues. Until now. This eye- opening book will offer you an in-depth understanding of evolution from a religio-scientific point of view. God The Evolver - Bridging The Gap Between Metaphysics \u0026 Science! If you are a serious free thinker without any religious or scientific prejudices; then this book is for you. If you are not afraid to step into spiritual no-man's land and test your knowledge; then this book will offer you a game-changing perspective. By combining religion; philosophy and science; author Faiz King has created a comprehensive guide to the struggle of religion and science. What Makes The Human Mind So Special? Back To Metaphysics. By the end of this book you will be able to understand the debate and realize that higher-order religious processes (e.g. Metaphysics) are necessary to realize the full extent of the rational and abstract properties of our human mind. And that's exactly what sets us apart from the rest of the creatures that live on this planet. God's Plan - How To Understand Centuries Of Evolution. After over 20 years of meticulous research; Faiz King has created the definitive successor to Charles Darwin's \"The Origin Of Species\" that is not afraid to take on this science giant and prove that Metaphysics (and subsequently God) is behind the development of modern science as we know it.

Called a mad In this �??informative and delightful�?� ( ) biography; Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of Nikola Tesla; one of the twentieth century�??s greatest scientists and inventors. In   Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of one of the twentieth century's greatest scientists and inventors. Called a madman by his enemies; a genius by others; and an enigma by nearly everyone; Nikola Tesla was; without a doubt; a trailblazing inventor who created astonishing; sometimes world-transforming devices that were virtually without theoretical precedent. Tesla not only discovered the rotating magnetic field -- the basis of most alternating-current machinery -- but also introduced us to the fundamentals of robotics; computers; and missile science. Almost supernaturally gifted; unfailingly flamboyant and neurotic; Tesla was troubled by an array of compulsions and phobias and was fond of extravagant; visionary experimentations. He was also a popular man-about-town; admired by men as diverse as Mark Twain and George Westinghouse; and adored by scores of society beauties.   From Tesla's childhood in Yugoslavia to his death in New York in the 1940s; Cheney paints a compelling human portrait and chronicles a lifetime of discoveries that radically altered -- and continue to alter -- the world in which we live.   is an in-depth look at the seminal accomplishments of a scientific wizard and a thoughtful examination of the obsessions and eccentricities of the man behind the science.",

In 1993; Castro attempted economic reform by allowing Cubans to use U.S. dollars and begin their own business ventures�??\"a huge messy free-for-all.\" This time of confused; low-rent capitalism is the backdrop for Pedro Juan Gutierrez's gritty; powerful; and atmospheric novel-in-stories;   translated from the original Spanish version by Natasha Wimmer. Gutierrez; whose prose sings of grime and simple; hard-clay truths; much like the words of  ; is a well-known member of the Latin American visual poetry movement and a magazine journalist living in Havana.   is written from the semiautobiographical point of view of Pedro Juan; a 40-year-old sex-starved ex-radio journalist cobbling together an existence by selling everything from himself to drugs to whatever he can get his hands on. \"Everything's worth something here;\" he writes. Pedro Juan is an ex-radio journalist because in a \"model\" communist society nothing bad is acceptable news. Through his tormented lead character; Gutierrez provides a window into his reasons for writing such a crude book. \"That's why I was disillusioned with journalism and why I started to write raw stories.... I write to jar people a little and force others to wake up and smell the shit.... That's how I terrorize cowards and mess with people who like to muzzle those of us who speak up.... My stories could run bare-assed out into the middle of the street; shouting; 'Freedom; freedom; freedom.'\" That said; be warned:   is not for the faint of heart. It is raw; squarely confronting poverty; racism; violence; prostitution; and the lengths Cubans go to in order to secure the almighty buck. In one story; the man who lives across the hall from Pedro Juan; in the crumbling apartment building that serves as the focal point for much of the book; is busted by the cops for stealing human livers from the morgue and selling them on the streets as pork livers. But survival isn't the only thing on the minds of Gutierrez's colorful characters. Oddly enough; it's the quest for release; for fits of pleasure; for some sliver of happiness no matter how warped the avenue may seem to the world outside Havana. And that quest is manifested in the hard-core sex that permeates the pages of the book. An orgasm is one of the few pleasures no one can be denied. As violent and nauseating as the sex -- and the life -- may seem on the surface; Gutierrez achieves the difficult task of lifting his characters from the muck; giving his   an intellectual and emotional depth that far outweighs the carnal. Near the end Gutierrez writes; \"Born in the ruins; they just kept trying not to give up or let themselves be beaten so severely that at last they were forced to surrender. Anything was possible; everything allowed; except defeat.\" The book then becomes a manifesto; a well-wrought fight against literary persecution; a release the same as an orgasm; where the truth behind every dark corner; behind every door; must be told.   comes from the same womb in which literature was born; a book that just may someday be held up beside those of the mighty dead.

Many of them have appeared only in foreign magazines while others were printed in small limited editions which have gone out of print.  Miller's genius for comedy is at its best in \"Money and How It Gets That Way\" -- a tongue-in-cheek parody of \"economics\" provoked by a postcard from Ezra Pound which asked if he \"ever thought about money.\" His deep concern for the role of the artist in society appears in \"An Open Letter to All and Sundry;\" and in \"The Angel is My Watermark\" he writes of his own passionate love affair with painting. \"The Immorality of Morality\" is an eloquent discussion of censorship. Some of the stories; such as \"First Love;\" are autobiographical; and there are portraits of friends; such as \"Patchen: Man of Anger and Light;\" and essays on other writers such as Walt Whitman; Thoreau; Sherwood Anderson and Ionesco. Taken together; these highly readable pieces reflect the incredible vitality and variety of interests of the writer who extended the frontiers of modern literature with   and other great books.",

Serano shares her experiences and observations�??both pre- and post-transition�??to reveal the ways in which fear; suspicion; and dismissiveness toward femininity shape our societal attitudes toward trans women; as well as gender and sexuality as a whole. Serano's well-honed arguments stem from her ability to bridge the gap between the often-disparate biological and social perspectives on gender. She exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is frivolous; weak; and passive; and how this �??feminine�?� weakness exists only to attract and appease male desire. In addition to debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality; Serano makes the case that today's feminists and transgender activist must work to embrace and empower femininity�??in all of its wondrous forms.",

Calling to mind such timeless war-and-love classics as   and  ; Guernica is a transporting novel that thrums with the power of storytelling and is peopled with characters driven by grit and heart. In 1935; Miguel Navarro finds himself in conflict with the Spanish Civil Guard; and flees the Basque fishing village of Lekeitio to make a new start in Guernica; the center of Basque culture and tradition. In the midst of this isolated bastion of democratic values; Miguel finds more than a new life�?? he finds someone to live for. Miren Ansotegui is a charismatic and graceful dancer who has her pick of the bachelors in Guernica; but focuses only on the charming and mysterious Miguel. The two discover a love that war and tragedy can not destroy. History and fiction merge seamlessly in this beautiful novel about the resilience of family; love; and tradition in the face of hardship. The bombing of Guernica was a devastating experiment in total warfare by the German Luftwaffe in the run-up to World War II. For Basques; it was an attack on the soul of their ancient nation; for the world; it was an unprecedented crime against humanity. In his first novel; Boling reintroduces the event and paints his own picture of a people so strong; vibrant; and proud that they are willing to do whatever it takes to protect their values; their country; and their loved ones.",

He himself worked on the codification; but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task was continued on the basis of his work; and the resulting volume was released in 1973. That publication included; in addition to the Synopsis and Codification itself and explanatory notes; a compilation of the passages from the Kitab-i-Aqdas which had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in various books. The Synopsis and Codification covered the text of both the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Questions and Answers which constitutes an appendix to the Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal House of Justice decided that the time had come when the preparation of an English translation of the complete text of the Most Holy Book was both possible and essential and made its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan 1986-1992. Its publication in English will be followed by translations in other languages. It has been recognized that the Kitab-i-Aqdas; being Sacred Scripture; should be presented in a form which can be read with ease and inspiration; uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers that are common in scholarly texts. Nonetheless; to assist the reader in following the flow of the text and its changing themes; paragraph divisions have been added�??such divisions not being common in works of Arabic literature�??and these paragraphs have then been numbered for ease of access and indexing; as well as for uniformity of reference in all the languages in which the work will be published. Following the text of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of Baha�??u�??llah which are supplementary to the Most Holy Book; and a translation of the Questions and Answers published here for the first time.

Ora; a middle-aged Israeli mother; is on the verge of celebrating her son Ofer�??s release from army service when he returns to the front for a major offensive. In a fit of preemptive grief and magical thinking; she sets out for a hike in the Galilee; leaving no forwarding information for the �??notifiers�?� who might darken her door with the worst possible news. Recently estranged from her husband; Ilan; she drags along an unlikely companion: their former best friend and her former lover Avram; once a brilliant artistic spirit. Avram served in the army alongside Ilan when they were young; but their lives were forever changed one weekend when the two jokingly had Ora draw lots to see which of them would get the few days�?? leave being offered by their commander�??a chance act that sent Avram into Egpyt and the Yom Kippur War; where he was brutally tortured as POW.  In the aftermath; a virtual hermit; he refused to keep in touch with the family and has never met the boy. Now; as Ora and Avram sleep out in the hills; ford rivers; and cross valleys; avoiding all news from the front; she gives him the gift of Ofer; word by word; she supplies the whole story of her motherhood; a retelling that keeps Ofer very much alive for Ora and for the reader; and opens Avram to human bonds undreamed of in his broken world. Their walk has a �??war and peace�?� rhythm; as their conversation places the most hideous trials of war next to the joys and anguish of raising children. Never have we seen so clearly the reality and surreality of daily life in Israel; the currents of ambivalence about war within one household; and the burdens that fall on each generation anew.  Grossman�??s rich imagining of a family in love and crisis makes for one of the great antiwar novels of our time.",

In that stream; faithfulness to the text and vigorous pursuit of accuracy were combined with simplicity; beauty; and dignity of expression. Our goal has been to carry forward this legacy for a new century. During the Reformation; a renewed interest in Scripture brought great light to the church and the world. In The Reformation Study Bible; general editor R. C. Sproul aims to present the light of the Reformation anew by combining an accessible translation with study notes that stand firmly in the theological tradition of the Reformation. No other study Bible gives the reader more assistance in understanding the great doctrines and themes of the Christian faith as found in the Scriptures. Extensive notes have been researched and written by a team of more than fifty scholars; including J. I. Packer; James Boice; and Wayne Grudem. All Christians that want to dig deeper in their study of Scripture will appreciate the Bible�??s many features; including section introductions; book introductions and outlines; comments on the biblical text; theological notes; charts; in-text maps; and cross-references. The first study bible based on the English Standard Version; The Reformation Study Bible is the perfect choice for men and women that want to study God�??s word in a language they can understand.",

Instead of looking at people afflicted with disease symptoms; this highly-respected dentist and dental researcher chose to focus on healthy individuals; and challenged himself to understand how they achieved such amazing health. Dr. Price traveled to hundreds of cities in a total of 14 different countries in his search to find healthy people. He investigated some of the most remote areas in the world. He observed perfect dental arches; minimal tooth decay; high immunity to tuberculosis and overall excellent health in those groups of people who ate their indigenous foods. He found when these people were introduced to modernized foods; such as white flour; white sugar; refined vegetable oils and canned goods; signs of degeneration quickly became quite evident. Dental caries; deformed jaw structures; crooked teeth; arthritis and a low immunity to tuberculosis became rampant amongst them. Dr. Price documented this ancestral wisdom including hundreds of photos in his book; Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.",

Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .�?�  Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work�??first as a child model in Australia; then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond; glamorous and successful. On the inside; she was literally dying.  In this searing; unflinchingly honest book; Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food; weight; and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day; from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn�??t enough; she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise; driving her body and spirit to the breaking point.  Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development; Portia alternately starved herself and binged; all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet; a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet; Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder.  From her lowest point; Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty; falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres; and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women�??s health issues.  In this remarkable and beautifully written work; Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies; Unbearable Lightness is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.",

Gabrian Shadwell studied hard and kept her nose to the grindstone in order to live the successful and full life that most humans strive for. The problem is; she isn't exactly human. After protection wards and cloaking spells that were cast to suppress any evidence of magic that may be running through her veins begins scratching it way through the surface; Gabrian fumbles with the unnerving discovery that she now can see hazy energy fragments emanating from her clients bodies. What is even more shocking is that she yearns to devour it. Her all so perfect and straight forward life as a normal mundane human is just a facade and coming to an end. Who she truly is are the things that spine chilling nightmares are made of. With no possible way to return to the simple life she once knew as an oblivious human; she struggles to concede to the fact that the calm reality of her world has shifted; it is now crawling with Borrowers; Mages and Shadow Walking-beings. But Gabrian's unyielding thirst for knowledge pushes her to dig her claws in and gain control over her gifts as an energy-lending Borrower as it is essential for her to survive and earn her place amongst them. Her chaotic journey of self-discovery takes her from the pan and throws her right into the fire when the tainted eyes of the self-righteous Elders in the realm turn against her and the silken tongued devil that lurks within the darkness of the realm seems to be the only thing with an empathetic concern towards her; for a price. Her soft hearted will combats with her logical inner voice about who is really telling her the truth. She tastes the sweet and sours of deception in the air from both sides but still she must choose which force will reign over her freedom and thus deciding how tight her shackles will be to the path that she will walk upon. It is an inner battle that she must fight in order to uncover the ugly answers that she seeks and along the way; Gabrian will fall face first into an important and absolute truth: sometimes the only difference between a Borrower and a Vampire is hope.\"",

For millions around the globe; sixteen-year-old Nujeen Mustafa embodies the best of the human spirit. Confined to a wheelchair because of her cerebral palsy and denied formal schooling in Syria because of her illness; Nujeen taught herself English by watching American soap operas. When her small town became the epicenter of the brutal fight between ISIS militants and US-backed Kurdish troops in 2014; she and her family were forced to flee. Despite her physical limitations; Nujeen embarked on the arduous trek to safety and a new life. The grueling sixteen-month odyssey by foot; boat; and bus took her across Turkey and the Mediterranean to Greece; through Macedonia to Serbia and Hungary; and finally; to Germany. Yet; in spite of the tremendous physical hardship she endured; Nujeen's extraordinary optimism never wavered. Refusing to give in to despair or see herself as a passive victim; she kept her head high. As she told a BBC reporter; \"You should fight to get what you want in this world.\" Nujeen's positivity and resolve infuses this unforgettable story of one young woman determined to make a better life for herself. Told by acclaimed British foreign correspondent Christina Lamb;   is a unique and powerful memoir that gives voice to the Syrian refugee crisis; helping us to understand that the world must change�??and offering the inspiration to make that change reality.",

Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true? While tackling these questions; Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers; you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists; criminologists; military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff; the trial of Amanda Knox; and the suicide of Sylvia Plath; you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's \"Hell You Talmbout.\" Something is very wrong; Gladwell argues; with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers; we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.",

The Snow-Walker's Son Since Gudrun came from the frozen mists beyond the edge of the world; the Jarl's people have obeyed her in hatred and terror. But the enchantress has one weakness: a son; Kari; banished to a forbidding fortress in the north; never seen by the Jarl's people. In secret they wonder: Are the rumours true? Was he born a monster? Now Jessa and her cousin Thorkil have been exiled to the north; and if they survive the journey; they will find the truth: Is Kari a beast? Or the means to stop the sorceress? The Empty Hand From frost and magic; the sorceress Gudrun conjures a rune beast and sends it from the land of the Snow-Walkers; southwards towards the stronghold of the new Jarl; Wulfgar. The approach of the beast spreads fear amongst the people. Jessa; Skapti the poet; and a slave named Hakon Empty Hand must help the Jarl confront this horror while around them; mistrust and conspiracy grow. In some hidden way; these dark events are linked with Gudrun's mysterious son; Kari; whose own talents as sorcerer are beginning to reach their terrifying potential. The Soul Thieves In the dramatic conclusion to the \"Snow-Walker\" trilogy; the sorceress Gudrun places an enchantment of frost and dreams upon the people of the Jarlshold and steals the soul of the Jarl's young bride. To reclaim the girl; Jessa and her friends must now begin a perilous quest to the land of Snow-Walkers; a place not shown on any map. They must journey beyond the edge of the world; beyond the rift into darkness; where the final battle between Gudrun and her son must take place.",

What started in games and laughter became for Paul and Elisabeth a drug too magical to resist. The crime which finally destroyed them has the inevitability of Greek tragedy.

When puritanical artist Henry Chester sees delicate child beauty Effie; he makes her his favorite model and; before long; his bride. But Henry; volatile and repressed; is in love with an ideal. Passive; docile; and asexual; the woman he projects onto Effie is far from the woman she really is. And when Effie begins to discover the murderous depths of Henry's hypocrisy; her latent passion will rise to the surface.  combines the ethereal beauty of a Pre-Raphaelite painting with a chilling high gothic tale and is a testament to Harris's brimming cornucopia of talents.

Cosmology/New Science Gaia theory argues that the flora and fauna of the planet operate in a self-regulating web that keeps the world livable. According to the theory; humankind is the most powerful species in this web and also its biggest threat. This provocative book explores ways to minimize and ultimately eliminate this threat with love and intimacy. Controversial Italian author Serena Anderlini-D�??Onofrio has authored the first global ecology study based on an analysis of human health. Anderlini-D�??Onofrio identifies her remedy within the context of Gaia theory; re-envisioning it as a more inclusive philosophy that positively impacts not only relationships; but world ecology under duress. The author links human sexuality to the global ecosystem; claiming that freedom from fear will stimulate a holistic health movement powerful enough to heal relationships and restore planetary balance. is bracing in its range; weaving together issues of human and global health; the relationship of politics; sexuality; and ecology; practices and styles of love; the changing roles of eroticism and gender in our lives; and polyamory; bisexuality; and the AIDS reappraisal movement. The argument of this book emphasizes the arts of loving as a way to help humanity make peace with our hostess Gaia; the third planet. Some of these arts involve sharing emotional resources and amorous partners. Often; the arts of loving require the use of barriers: mechanical protections such as condoms. At times they do not because only tantric energies are exchanged. The author of this book is persuaded that barriers are recommendable when sexual practices result in the exchange of deep body fluids; unless previous fluid-bonding arrangements have been made. The author is also persuaded that good practices of holistic health contribute to strengthening the immune systems of those who engage in the arts of loving. Safety practices are important in making the arts of loving healthy regardless of what factors are involved in the syndromes most prevalent today; including AIDS and other conditions in the STD spectrum. Historically; disagreement has moved knowledge forward: Today�??s science is the result of yesterday�??s disagreements and controversies. The author believes in critical thinking and she respects dissidence in science today; including Gaia science; reappraisals of AIDS; and holistic medicine. She hopes her readers will be open to hearing more than one side of a story. This statement and the contents of this book do not constitute medical advice in any way. Readers are invited to consult their own healers and health care providers. Serena Anderlini-D�??Onofrio; PhD Author of  Cabo Rojo; Puerto Rico; March 2010 Blog: ",

Still convincingly female; though in no way dumb and girly; fortyish Juanita serves drinks to the colorful crew patronizing Herb's Cafe in South Fort Worth; worries herself sick over a hot-to-trot daughter proving too fond of drugs and the dealers who sell them; endures a hypochondriac mother whose whinings would justify murder; dates a fellow middle-ager whose connections with the oil industry are limited to dipstick duty at his filling station�??and; by the way; she also hopes to become a singer-songwriter in the real country tradition of Bob Wills and Willie Nelson. That Juanita is way too old to remain a kid with a crazy dream doesn't matter much to her. In between handing out longneck beers to customer-acquaintances battling hot flashes and deciding when boyfriend Slick is finally going to get lucky; Juanita keeps jotting down lyrics reflective of hard-won wisdom and setting them to music composed on her beloved Martin guitar. Too many of her early songwriting results are one-dimensional or derivative; but finally she hits on something both original and heartfelt: a tribute to her beloved home state; warts and all.",

She has told everyone that she is doing field research; but in fact she has made the journey to escape her family. When she learns that she is believed to have died in a terrible boating accident and that her children have misidentified a mutilated body as her own; she decides to keep the truth hidden and remain �??dead.�?� Alone in the jungle; she begins reassessing the lies and legends upon which the foundations of her family�??s history have been constructed.  Thousands of miles away; Isabel�??s daughter; Serena; and the rest of the family have gathered at her parents�?? beachhouse near Barcelona. Serena is keeping a diary and trying to make sense of her family and its history. Her voice echoes; enhances; and at times challenges her mother�??s memories and perceptions.  An intricately wrought; multilayered novel�??and winner of the Premi Llibreter in Spain (The Bookseller�??s Award)�??LIES ranges from the present to deep into the past. As Isabel and Serena recount spellbinding tales of love affairs and scandals within the Azuera family; the lies and legends that have influenced generations gradually come to light. Interwoven into the narratives are beautifully-told digressions on the tribal customs and cultures; funerary rituals; and even the legends surrounding the eighth-century Chinese poet Li Po.  Some of the stories are brutal; others droll; and still others exciting. Together they illuminate the importance of storytelling in shaping our beliefs about our families and ourselves.",

He opens a window on his private life; from his boyhood dislike of school to his daughter�??s precocious melancholy; from his successful struggle to quit smoking to his anxiety at the prospect of testifying against some clumsy muggers who fell upon him during a visit to New York City. From ordinary obligations such as applying for a passport or sharing a holiday meal with relatives; he takes extraordinary flights of imagination; in extreme moments; such as the terrifying days following a cataclysmic earthquake in Istanbul; he lays bare our most basic hopes and fears. Again and again Pamuk declares his faith in fiction; engaging the work of such predecessors as Laurence Sterne and Fyodor Dostoyevsky; sharing fragments from his notebooks; and commenting on his own novels. He contemplates his mysterious compulsion to sit alone at a desk and dream; always returning to the rich deliverance that is reading and writing.

We donate our time and money to charities and causes we deem worthy; choose careers we consider meaningful; and patronize businesses and buy products we believe make the world a better place. Unfortunately; we often base these decisions on assumptions and emotions rather than facts. As a result; even our best intentions often lead to ineffective�??and sometimes downright harmful�??outcomes. How can we do better?  While a researcher at Oxford; trying to figure out which career would allow him to have the greatest impact; William MacAskill confronted this problem head on. He discovered that much of the potential for change was being squandered by lack of information; bad data; and our own prejudice. As an antidote; he and his colleagues developed effective altruism; a practical; data-driven approach that allows each of us to make a tremendous difference regardless of our resources. Effective altruists believe that it�??s not enough to simply do good; we must do good better.  At the core of this philosophy are five key questions that help guide our altruistic decisions: How many people benefit; and by how much? Is this the most effective thing I can do? Is this area neglected? What would have happened otherwise? What are the chances of success; and how good would success be? By applying these questions to real-life scenarios; MacAskill shows how many of our assumptions about doing good are misguided. For instance; he argues one can potentially save more lives by becoming a plastic surgeon rather than a heart surgeon; measuring overhead costs is an inaccurate gauge of a charity�??s effectiveness; and; it generally doesn�??t make sense for individuals to donate to disaster relief.  MacAskill urges us to think differently; set aside biases; and use evidence and careful reasoning rather than act on impulse. When we do this�??when we apply the head  the heart to each of our altruistic endeavors�??we find that each of us has the power to do an astonishing amount of good.",

Once; Abrielle's name was on the lips of every unwed nobleman in London as a proud exceptional lady coveted for her bearing; her breeding; her wit; and her beauty. But when her stepfather�??respected for his courage and valor during the Crusades�??is denied his rightful title and the wealth that accompanies it; Abrielle finds herself suddenly disgraced; no longer a suitable match for any proper gentleman. Only one would still have her; though he desires no more than physical pleasure: the oafish and grotesque Desmond de Marlé. His dark and scandalous reputation is legend; and Abrielle has heard rumors that his first two wives perished by his hand. Yet no one else can rescue her once-proud family's honor and keep her stepfather from debtor's prison; so she is left with no choice but to accept the cruel and hateful de Marlé's offer of marriage and sacrifice her virtue to a scoundrel she fears and detests . . . even as she yearns for another lover. Dashing; handsome; tall; and kind�??a black-haired Scotsman with vivid blue eyes�??Raven Seabern is an emissary for his king; and quite unlike any man Abrielle has ever encountered. From the very first moment their eyes meet; he intrigues and mesmerizes her�??and dancing in his arms at a royal banquet leaves her weak with the desire to surrender.

Nearly three quarters of a million copies have been sold; and the book became a much-loved; Academy Award�??winning film starring Timothée Chalamet as the young Elio and Armie Hammer as Oliver; the graduate student with whom he falls in love.

The \"last great mystery of science;\" consciousness was excluded from serious research for most of the last century but is now a rapidly expanding area of study for students of psychology; philosophy; and neuroscience. Recently the topic has also captured growing popular interest.   This groundbreaking book is the first volume to bring together all the major theories of consciousness studies--from those rooted in traditional Western philosophy to those coming out of neuroscience; quantum theory; and Eastern philosophy. Broadly interdisciplinary; Consciousness: AnIntroduction is divided into nine sections that examine such topics as how subjective experiences arise from objective brain processes; the basic neuroscience and neuropathology of consciousness; altered states of consciousness; mystical experiences and dreams; and the effects of drugs and meditation. It also discusses the nature of self; the possibility of artificial consciousness in robots; and the question of whether or not animals are conscious. Enhanced by numerous illustrations and profiles of important researchers; the book also includes self-assessment questions; further reading suggestions; and practical exercises that help bring the subject to life.",

Baby Boy Fisher--as he was documented in his child welfare caseworkers' reports--was raised in institutions from the moment of his birth in prison to a single mother. After beginning his life in an orphanage; Antwone was placed in a temporary foster home until; around age two; he was transferred to a second foster home. It was there; over the next thirteen years; that he endured emotional abandonment and physical abuse. Removed from this foster home not long before his sixteenth birthday; Antwone found fleeting refuge in a boys' reform school but was soon thrust into the nightmare of homelessness. Though convinced he was unwanted and unworthy; Fish; as he came to be known; refused to allow his spirit to be broken. Instead; he became determined to raise himself; to listen to social workers and teachers who intervened on his behalf; and to nurture a romantic heart along with a scathing sense of humor and a wondrous imagination--all of which sustained him with big dreams of a better day. Fatefully; just as Antwone's life on the streets hit rock bottom; he enlisted in the United States Navy; where he remained for the next eleven years. During that time; Fish became a man of the world; raised by the Navy family he created for himself. Finding Fish shows how; out of this unlikely mix of deprivation and hope; an artist was born--first as the child who painted the feelings his words dared not speak; then as a poet and storyteller who would eventually become one of Hollywood's most well-paid; sought-after screenwriters. But before he ascends those lofty steps; Antwone's story takes us from the Navy to his jobs as a federal correctional officer and then a security guard at Sony Pictures in Hollywood. In its climactic conclusion; the mystery of his identity is finally unraveled as Antwone returns to Cleveland to locate his mother's and father's surviving family members. A tumultuous and ultimately gratifying tale of self-discovery written in Fisher's gritty yet melodic literary voice; Finding Fish is an unforgettable reading experience.",

In this first volume of the Liberation Trilogy; Rick Atkinson shows why no modern reader can understand the ultimate victory of the Allied powers without a grasp of the great drama that unfolded in North Africa in 1942 and 1943. That first year of the Allied war was a pivotal point in American history; the moment when the United States began to act like a great power. Beginning with the daring amphibious invasion in November 1942; An Army at Dawn follows the American and British armies as they fight the French in Morocco and Algeria; and then take on the Germans and Italians in Tunisia. Battle by battle; an inexperienced and sometimes poorly led army gradually becomes a superb fighting force. Central to the tale are the extraordinary but fallible commanders who come to dominate the battlefield: Eisenhower; Patton; Bradley; Montgomery; and Rommel. Brilliantly researched; rich with new material and vivid insights; Atkinson's narrative provides the definitive history of the war in North Africa.",

Talyn long ago embraced her fate: to die in battle.

But the Feegash came from across the world; and demanded to be allowed to negotiate peace between the Eastil and the Tonk for the sake of the rest of the world. Their success meant Talyn was out of a job; and at a loss for what to do with her life. Rather than follow most of her fellow soldiers to jobs in other parts of the world; Talyn stayed with her family in her town--and there she is seduced by a Feegash diplomat. With him she experiences a dark side of herself that she hadn't even imagined; and learns a new kind of magery. And she discovers the mistreatment of Eastil prisoners of war; still in Tonk hands; and weighs her life against saving theirs. It's a matter of honor--and her honor will be challenged again and again as she slowly discovers that what the Feegash have brought with them was not peace but an overwhelming oppression; and an evil so insidious no one noticed it until it was too late. But if Talyn can hone her use of the Feegash flesh-magery; she can turn their own magic back against them. With the help of one of the Eastil prisoners; she might be able to use it to save the Tonk andthe Eastil; and defeat the Feegash once and for all... if it doesn't destroy her from the inside out first.",

Huli; who in reality is a two thousand-year-old were-fox who seduces men in order to absorb their life force; she does this by means of her tail; a hypnotic organ that puts men into a trance in which they dream they are having sex with her. A. Huli eventually comes to the attention of and falls in love with a high-ranking Russian intelligence officer named Alexander; who is also a werewolf (unbeknownst to our heroine).

It is 1957; and Lewis Aldridge; straight out of prison; is journeying back to his home in Waterford; a suburban town outside London. He is nineteen years old; and his return will have dramatic consequences not just for his family; but for the whole community.  A decade earlier; his father's homecoming has a very different effect. The war is over and Gilbert has been demobilized. He reverts easily to suburban life�??cocktails at six-thirty; church on Sundays�??but his wife and young son resist the stuffy routine. Lewis and his mother escape to the woods for picnics; just as they did in wartime days. Nobody is surprised that Gilbert's wife counters convention; but they are all shocked when; after one of their jaunts; Lewis comes back without her.  Not far away; Kit Carmichael keeps watch. She has always understood more than most; not least from what she is dealt by her own father's hand. Lewis's grief and burgeoning rage are all too plain; and Kit makes a private vow to help. But in her attempts to set them both free; she fails to foresee the painful and horrifying secrets that must first be forced into the open.  In this brilliant debut; Sadie Jones tells the story of a boy who refuses to accept the polite lies of a tightly knit community that rejects love in favor of appearances. Written with nail-biting suspense and cinematic pacing; The Outcast is an emotionally powerful evocation of postwar provincial English society and a remarkably uplifting testament to the redemptive powers of love and understanding.",

Written in 1936 and published the following year; this brilliant and profound evaluation of Stalinism from the Marxist standpoint prophesied the collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent related events. The effects of the October Revolution led to the establishment of a nationalized planned economy; demonstrating the practicality of socialism for the first time. By the 1930s; however; the Soviet workers' democracy had crumbled into a state of bureaucratic decay that ultimately gave rise to an infamous totalitarian regime. Trotsky employs facts; figures; and statistics to show how Stalinist policies rejected the enormous productive potential of the nationalized planned economy in favor of a wasteful and corrupt bureaucratic system. Six decades after the publication of this classic; the shattering of Stalinist regimes in Russia and Eastern Europe has confused and demoralized countless political activists.   offers readers of every political persuasion an insider's view of what went wrong.",

Until a distant connection; ignorant of his selfishness; applies to him for help. When Frederica Merriville brings her three younger siblings to London determined to secure a brilliant marriage for her beautiful sister; Charis; she seeks out their distant cousin the Marquis of Alverstoke. Lovely; competent; and refreshingly straightforward; Frederica makes such a strong impression that to his own amazement; the Marquis agrees to help launch them all into society. Lord Alverstoke can't resist wanting to help her Normally wary of his family; which includes two overbearing sisters and innumerable favor-seekers; Lord Alverstoke does his best to keep his distance. The Merrivales; a family of solid social standing; have fallen into unhappy financial straits; and the marriage might deliver them from this situation. They have come to London for the glittering social season; in order to give young and beautiful Charis a chance to make a good marriage; she may be as hen-witted as she is beautiful. Frederica herself; a gay and witty charmer; believes herself happily beyond marriageable age -- she is twenty-four; after all. They boys are also very differents; Jessamy is an interesting boy; and Felix an engaging scamp. Frederica is saddened when her prime prospect; their distant cousin Lord Alverstroke; seems totally uninterested. But when they are introduced to London society by the Marquis of Alverstoke; they find themselves both besieged by more suitors than they can possibly handle! With his enterprising - and altogether entertaining - country cousins getting into one scrape after another right on his doorstep; before he knows it the cold Marquis finds himself dangerously embroiled and plunged into one drama after another by the large and irrepressible Merriville family; Alverstoke is surprised to find himself far from bored. He is amazed to find herself; unknowingly; finds himself thoroughly beguiled by his distand cousins and; most intriguing of all; their strongminded sister Frederica; who seems more concerned with her family's welfare than his own distinguished attentions. And when his younger cousin ends up in a terrible accident; the dutiful Marquis becomes as chivalrous as ever to the those in his charge. And Frederica begins to imagine the Marquis as match... for herself.",

The son of an Alabama sharecropper; and now a sixth-term United States Congressman; John Lewis has led an extraordinary life; one that found him at the epicenter of the civil rights movement in the late '50s and '60s. As Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC); Lewis was present at all the major battlefields of the movement. Arrested more than forty times and severely beaten on several occasions; he was one of the youngest yet most courageous leaders.  Written with charm; warmth; and honesty;   offers rare insight into the movement and the personalities of all the civil rights leaders-what was happening behind the scenes; the infighting; struggles; and triumphs. Lewis takes us from the Nashville lunch counter sit-ins to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma; Alabama; where he led more than five hundred marchers on what became known as \"Bloody Sunday.\" While there have been exceptional books on the movement; there has never been a front-line account by a man like John Lewis. A true American hero; his story is \"destined to become a classic in civil rights literature.\" (Los Angeles Times)",

Newly graduated from college and an aspiring writer; Beth Hayes craves independence and has a world to conquer. But her notions of travel; graduate study; and writing the great American novel will have to be postponed. With her mother; Susan; leaving to fulfill her own dreams in Paris and her Aunt Maggie; Uncle Grant; and stepfather; Simon; moving to California; Beth is elected by her elders to house-sit the Island Gamble. Surrounded by the shimmering blue waters of the Atlantic; the white clapboards; silver tin roof; and confessional porch have seen and heard the stories of generations of Hamiltons. But will the ghosts of the Island Gamble be watching over Beth? Buoyed by sentimental memories of growing up on this tiny sandbar that seems to be untouched by time; Beth vows to give herself over to the Lowcountry force and discover the wisdom it holds. She will rest; rejuvenate; and then reenter the outside world. Just as she vows she will never give into the delusional world of white picket fences; minivans; and eternal love; she meets Max Mitchell. And all her convictions and plans begin to unravel with lightning speed. There is so much about life and her family's past that she does not know. Her ignorance and naiveté nearly cost her both her inheritance and her family's respect. But Beth finds unexpected friends to help her through the disaster she faces: her wise and charming Aunt Sophie; Cecily Singleton; the granddaughter of Livvie Singleton; and Woody Morrison; the solid young investment banker. This wonderful ensemble of characters could be your own family; but watch what unfolds as they succumb to the island's spell. If everything happens for a reason; then Beth's return to Sullivans Island teaches her that betrayal and tragedy are most easily handled when you surround yourself with loyal family and friends in a magical place that loves you so much that it wants to claim you as its own.",

He is painfully unaware that these torments are due to the secret manipulations of New Renaissance; an experimental organization that is testing the age-old idea that art results from suffering. Since culture is so significantly influenced by music; movies; and television; New Renaissance hopes to improve the mindless mainstream by raising writers who emphasize artistic quality over commerce. As part of its top-secret sub-project; New Renaissance hires reluctant ex-musician Harlan Eiffler to manipulate its most promising prodigy; Vincent. Wickedly antisocial and deeply disgusted by what passes for entertainment in the twenty-first century; Harlan clandestinely pulls the strings so that Vincent remains a true artist. All the while; he poses as Vincent's manager; simultaneously nurturing his prolific career and torturing his soul.",

He is one of the symp-toms of our times�??from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder; at some time or another; what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run? This is the question Schulberg has asked himself; and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick; the man with a positive genius for being a heel; who runs through New York�??s East Side; through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood; leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic�??his congenital incapacity for friendship. An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and; in so doing; destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol; and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening. When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine; Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick�??s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless; for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself; who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936; but has spent his life; literally; in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood; but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.",

But he ignored that warning and plunged to his doom. We�??ve retold this myth; and many others like it; to generations of kids. All these stories have the same lesson: Play it safe. Obey your parents. Listen to the experts. It was the perfect propaganda for the industrial economy. What boss wouldn�??t want employees to believe that obedience and conformity are the keys to success? But there�??s another part of the myth that those in power hope you�??ll forget. Icarus was also warned not to fly too low; because sea water would ruin the lift in his wings. Flying too low is even more dangerous than flying too high; because it feels deceptively safe. The safety zone has moved. The propaganda has been exposed; and the old promises have been broken: Conformity no longer leads to comfort. But the good news is that creativity is scarce; and more valuable than ever. So is choosing to do something unpredictable and brave: make art. Being an artist isn�??t a genetic disposition or a specific talent. It�??s an attitude we can all adopt. It�??s a hunger to seize new ground; make connections; and work without a map. If you do those things you�??re an artist; no matter what it says on your business card. Whether you�??re a teacher; engineer; doctor; middle manager; or customer service rep; you can fly higher by bringing your best self to work.

And it inspired two close friends to get together in Dharamsala for a talk about something very important to them. The friends were His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The subject was joy. Both winners of the Nobel Prize; both great spiritual masters and moral leaders of our time; they are also known for being among the most infectiously happy people on the planet. From the beginning the book was envisioned as a three-layer birthday cake: their own stories and teachings about joy; the most recent findings in the science of deep happiness; and the daily practices that anchor their own emotional and spiritual lives. Both the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu have been tested by great personal and national adversity; and here they share their personal stories of struggle and renewal. Now that they are both in their eighties; they especially want to spread the core message that to have joy yourself; you must bring joy to others. Most of all; during that landmark week in Dharamsala; they demonstrated by their own exuberance; compassion; and humor how joy can be transformed from a fleeting emotion into an enduring way of life.",

Almost thirty-five million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the In 1930; the American historian and philosopher Will Durant wrote that Britain�??s �??conscious and deliberate bleeding of India�?� [was the] greatest crime in all history�??. He was not the only one to denounce the rapacity and cruelty of British rule; and his assessment was not exaggerated. Almost thirty-five million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the British�??in famines; epidemics; communal riots and wholesale slaughter like the reprisal killings after the 1857 War of Independence and the Amritsar massacre of 1919.  Besides the deaths of Indians; British rule impoverished India in a manner that beggars belief. When the East India Company took control of the country; in the chaos that ensued after the collapse of the Mughal empire; India�??s share of world GDP was 23 per cent. When the British left it was just above 3 per cent.  The British empire in India began with the East India Company; incorporated in 1600; by royal charter of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I; to trade in silk; spices and other profitable Indian commodities. Within a century and a half; the Company had become a power to reckon with in India. In 1757; under the command of Robert Clive; Company forces defeated the ruling Nawab Siraj-ud-Daula of Bengal at Plassey; through a combination of superior artillery and even more superior chicanery. A few years later; the young and weakened Mughal emperor; Shah Alam II; was browbeaten into issuing an edict that replaced his own revenue officials with the Company�??s representatives. Over the next several decades; the East India Company; backed by the British government; extended its control over most of India; ruling with a combination of extortion; double-dealing; and outright corruption backed by violence and superior force. This state of affairs continued until 1857; when large numbers of the Company�??s Indian soldiers spearheaded the first major rebellion against colonial rule. After the rebels were defeated; the British Crown took over power and ruled the country ostensibly more benignly until 1947; when India won independence.  In this explosive book; bestselling author Shashi Tharoor reveals with acuity; impeccable research; and trademark wit; just how disastrous British rule was for India. Besides examining the many ways in which the colonizers exploited India; ranging from the drain of national resources to Britain; the destruction of the Indian textile; steel-making and shipping industries; and the negative transformation of agriculture; he demolishes the arguments of Western and Indian apologists for Empire on the supposed benefits of British rule; including democracy and political freedom; the rule of law; and the railways.   The few unarguable benefits�??the English language; tea; and cricket�??were never actually intended for the benefit of the colonized but introduced to serve the interests of the colonizers. Brilliantly narrated and passionately argued;   will serve to correct many misconceptions about one of the most contested periods of Indian history.",

After dominating the scholastic chess world for ten years; Waitzkin exp Josh Waitzkin knows what it means to be at the top of his game. A public figure since winning his first National Chess Championship at the age of nine; Waitzkin was catapulted into a media whirlwind as a teenager when his father's book \"Searching for Bobby Fischer\" was made into a major motion picture. After dominating the scholastic chess world for ten years; Waitzkin expanded his horizons; taking on the martial art Tai Chi Chuan and ultimately earning the title of World Champion. How was he able to reach the pinnacle of two disciplines that on the surface seem so different? \"I've come to realize that what I am best at is not Tai Chi; and it is not chess;\" he says. \"What I am best at is the art of learning.\"In his riveting new book; \"The Art of Learning;\" Waitzkin tells his remarkable story of personal achievement and shares the principles of learning and performance that have propelled him to the top -- twice. With a narrative that combines heart-stopping martial arts wars and tense chess face-offs with life lessons that speak to all of us; \"The Art of Learning\" takes readers through Waitzkin's unique journey to excellence. He explains in clear detail how a well-thought-out; principled approach to learning is what separates success from failure. Waitzkin believes that achievement; even at the championship level; is a function of a lifestyle that fuels a creative; resilient growth process. Rather than focusing on climactic wins; Waitzkin reveals the inner workings of his everyday method; from systematically triggering intuitive breakthroughs; to honing techniques into states of remarkable potency; to mastering the art of performance psychology. Through his own example; Waitzkin explains how to embrace defeat and make mistakes work for you. Does your opponent make you angry? Waitzkin describes how to channel emotions into creative fuel. As he explains it; obstacles are not obstacles but challenges to overcome; to spur the growth process by turning weaknesses into strengths. He illustrates the exact routines that he has used in all of his competitions; whether mental or physical; so that you too can achieve your peak performance zone in any competitive or professional circumstance. In stories ranging from his early years taking on chess hustlers as a seven year old in New York City's Washington Square Park; to dealing with the pressures of having a film made about his life; to International Chess Championships in India; Hungary; and Brazil; to gripping battles against powerhouse fighters in Taiwan in the Push Hands World Championships; \"The Art of Learning\" encapsulates an extraordinary competitor's life lessons in a page-turning narrative.",

Nothing ha Inspired by actual letters;   breathes life into history with a richly imagined chronicle of twenty tumultuous years in the marriage of two American pioneers.   Strong-willed Southern belle Mary Bullitt abandons her life of luxury in Louisville; Kentucky; when she marries General Henry Atkinson and accompanies him to his outpost on the Mississippi. Nothing has prepared her for marriage to this attractive older man -- or for the realities of frontier living. Conditions are primitive; Mary knows virtually nothing about her husband; and the threat of attack from Indians is constant. A rough and resourceful general; Henry is engaged in a long and historic clash with a great Native American leader; and his deeply conflicted feelings about Indians mirror those he and his wife have for each other.   In the tradition of Willa Cather and Edna Ferber; Micaela Gilchrist has crafted an exciting novel that is at once a love story and an action-packed depiction of the struggle for the West.",
